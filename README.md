Repository Contains:

Codes and Projects Developed as a part of Academic coursework for M.Sc. in Computational Science at George Mason University; or as a part of online courses related to it.

All Code in the repository are developed by me, except in High Performance Computing where I have added the kernels and CUDA function calls to perform calculations. 

Here is an overview of the codes in the directories:

/High Performance Computing: Parallel codes written in C, MPI and OpenMP. Visualisation using MATLAB.

/High Performance Parallel Programming: Parallel GPGPU code in C and CUDA.

/Image Processing Algorithms: Image manipulation codes written in Python, Scipy and Numpy

/Modelling and Simulation: Computational Simulation codes in C and visualization using MATLAB.

/Non-linear Optimization: Codes for numerical modelling and solving optimization problems. Implemented using MATLAB and some AMPL codes

/Numerical Methods: MATLAB code for some simple numerical methods.
