Repository Contains:

Codes and Projects Developed as a part of Academic coursework for M.Sc. in Computational Science at George Mason University; or as a part of online courses related to it.

All Code in the repository are developed by me, except in High Performance Computing where I have added the kernels and CUDA function calls to perform calculations. Other code snips in this directory is for measuring the performance of the computation (not added by me).

Feel free to browse, download, reuse or comment (as long as it isn't against honor code in your univ ;) ).
