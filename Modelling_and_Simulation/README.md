===========================================
Projects in CSI 701 - Foundations of Computational Science

General Summary: 	

All code can be run on Linux machines. Uses Makefiles to compile dependencies.
Simulation Outputs can be found in "output" folders after running. 
The "inputs" file can be used to set input and simulation parameters.
