1. Program tries to solve the coupled ODEs given in HW1 of CSI 701.

2. There are two ways to run the program:
	i. Automatic - just run
		 $make
	ii. Interactive - User can enter values and see the output data, but must run gnuplot using the command
		$./main
		$gnuplot gnuplot_commands
	
		This will generate the graph.

3. The main driver, numeric method functions and ODE functions are in the respective files. Eg:
	runge-kutta - rungekutta.c
	leap-frog - leap-frog.c
	
   The input_output.c only has the supporting I/O functions.
   
4. All outputs are in "outputs" directory
